    ```sql
    create database iotbay;
    USE iotbay;
    CREATE TABLE users (

        verificationCode VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
        registrationDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    CREATE TABLE user_access_logs (
        log_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        user_email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        login_datetime DATETIME NOT NULL,
        logout_datetime DATETIME,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_email) REFERENCES users(email)
